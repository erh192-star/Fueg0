Designers do this by "calling" a <div class> in HTML and defining the class attributes on the style sheet. Doing so saves time and results in less code. On the style.css page you'll find attributes relating font, text size, image size, among other details.-->

<!--Designers refer to this next section as a "Hero Image." The hero image is styled on the style.css page by calling a "class." To replace the hero image, simply place a .jpg file in the same file folder (directory) as this project and name it "hero.jpg." Alternatively, if you are working with a .png, you will need to open the style.css file using your text editor, find the "hero-image" class and change the file type from ".jpg" to ".png."" Browsers will only work with .jpg, .jpeg, or .png images. Since hero images need to stretch across the screen, typically you will want to select an image 1200px in width to allow quick load time yet avoid pixilation.-->

  <h2>Field of Study</h2>
  <p>I am currently a sophomore at the University of Pittsburgh majoring in Biological Sciences. I hope to go on to PA school after I get my undergraduate degree. I’ve always had a passion for helping people, and studying science has shown me how much I enjoy learning about the human body and health. This year, I hope to get more involved in opportunities that allow me to connect with others and continue building toward a career where I can make a difference.</p>

  <h2>Knowledge, Tools, and Skills</h2>
    <p>I enjoy writing but I am lacking in the technology aspect, which I think is an important skill to learn in this day and age. I don’t really have hard skills with coding or advanced design programs, but I’ve gained some experience using tools like Canva and Instagram for myself and for school. I like to draw and create things, and I’d like to find ways to bring that creativity into digital formats. I think learning new tech skills will push me outside my comfort zone and help me grow, especially since I’ve always been stronger in subjects like biology and anatomy.</p>

  <h2>What is good design?</h2>
      <h3> I think a good design is something colorful that immediately draws your attention. It should stand out but still look clean and organized so it’s easy to follow. A good design balances creativity with clarity, making sure it’s not just eye-catching but also gets the message across.<p></p>

   <h2>In the Future</h2>
      <p>In the future, I hope to become a Physician Assistant and build a career helping others through medicine. I would also love to travel the world, specifically backpacking through Europe with my best friend and experiencing new places and cultures together.</p>
